### The Python Data Model

The python data model is used to enrich our objects. When we leverage the python data model,
we make our objects to behave correctly and reasonbly in different situation when using
special syntax. For example, when our object has to behave like a collection object, we need
to leverage the python data model by implemeting **special methods** related to the desired
behavior.

Using special methods, which are written with leading and trailing double scores, the python
interpreter invokes the suitable methods on our object.

##### Situations where our objects could behave exceptionally
 - Collections
 - Iterations
 - function overloading
 - Attribute Access
 - String representation and formating
 and so on.

 In a nuthsell, implementing our python objects with Python Data Model, makes it possible
 to enhance our object with python core lanuage features and python standrard library feathers.
